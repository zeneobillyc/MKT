# ZENEO Marketing Website

## Logo
✅ The official ZENEO logo has been added to all pages in the navigation

## Video Banner Setup

### Adding Your Video
1. Place your hero banner video file in the MKT folder
2. Name it `hero-video.mp4` (or update the filename in `index.html`)
3. The video will autoplay, loop, and be muted by default

### Video Fallback
If no video is found, a gradient background will display instead.

### Recommended Video Specifications

- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (for looping)
- File size: Keep under 10MB for faster loading
